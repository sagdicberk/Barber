BarberApp - Backend Project

This project focuses on scheduling appointments. Firstly, I created an SMS service for sending verification codes and performing validation. The service can also send general messages. I used the Twilio SMS service API, but I encountered some problems. Twilioâ€™s free plan only allows one phone number, which prevented me from fully testing the appointment methods for the different roles (Barber, SuperBarber, Customer).

Technologies Used in the Project:

Spring Boot (Java): Used for backend development.
PostgreSQL: Database management.
Twilio API: Used for SMS verification and messaging services.
